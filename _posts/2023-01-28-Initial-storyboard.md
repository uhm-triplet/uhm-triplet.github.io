## How did we start
One of our teammates, Scott, preferred making a rhythm game at the beginning. By that time, I (Yong U Cho) and Shane were open to making any game, so we decided to make a rhythm game and think of an idea for that.

As a programmer, I first thought that rhythm games would not be very difficult to develop. Then, we started to think "What makes a rhythm game a good rhythm game?" Our answer was: good music and the beatmaps that fit that music. However, since we are not an expert in music, we had to think of other ways that can make the game "fun".

## Mix of two different types of game
So I suggested to the team members. How about creating a game where users can interact with each other by adding multi-play instead of just single-play rhythm games? Playing multiplayer between the same rhythm games has less interactive elements, so I wanted to enrich the game by mixing the rhythm game with other types of games.  
  
There were many opinions such as racing, 2D battle, 3D battle, etc., and first of all, 3D TPS shooting was decided. Since two game logic had to be implemented, we decided to develop the two games simple and then implement additional functions on top of that.

## Beats Bang 
### Overview
 - Competitive 2 vs 2
 - Each team has a Rhythm player and combat player 
 - Rhythm player's performance supports combat player
 - Final score determined by the total of the two players when the song ends 

### Rhythm Player
- Two button input
- Each button plays their own beatmap in sync with each other
- Hitting the notes gives different types of resources to the combat player 
-  * what kind of resources they need (health, ammo, swag, money)
- Combo + score is converted to the final score

### Combat Player
- TPS 
- Weapons, ammo, health, etc are all obtainable only from the rhythm player
- Kills / Damage is converted to the final score
