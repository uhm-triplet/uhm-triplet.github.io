### Rhythm Player
Each correct note hit by the rhythm player will be converted to resources for the combat player. The rhythm player is able to switch between three different modes (health/ammo/strength) to provide their teammate with the desired resource. A streak of 50 notes will reward the shooter with a powerful grenade!

#### Health Mode (green)
While this mode is selected, notes will contribute toward replenishing the combat player's health bar. 

#### Ammo Mode (orange)
While this mode is selected, notes will contribute toward replenishing the combat player's number of bullets.

#### Strength Mode (blue)
While this mode is selected, notes will contribute toward increasing the combat player's damage multiplier per bullet. But be careful, this damage multiplier is only in effect when strength mode is selected. 

### Combat Player
Eliminate all enemies of each type with the supplies given from the rhythm player! Keep track of what you need and let your rhythm partner know!
